GameOfLife
==========

Processing project to simulate the idea of Convay's [Game Of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

This project allow users to create live/dead cells by clicking on a toroidal grid. It either multiplies or dies off in each time step based on its neighboring cells' state. This is based upon certain rules as defined in the Game of Life. Some of the main features of this project are:
- Easy insertion of basic gliders, oscillators and glider guns
- Randomization of grid content
- Switching between single step and continuous mode

The main file in the project is [this processing file](https://github.com/muraliavarma/GameOfLife/blob/master/Murali_Varma_hw1/Murali_Varma_hw1.pde). More details can be found in the code comments.
